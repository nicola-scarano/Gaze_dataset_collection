# Gaze dataset collection with Pepper Softbank camera
The presented experiment aims at extracting statistical information from gaze
prediction data obtained from the current state-of-the-art algorithms for gaze
estimation. We hope that the results will allow researchers in various fields to
have a common baseline for future gaze-tracking works. Each participant must
gaze at dots that appear in different positions on a screen in front of him. It
will repeat the procedure standing on 9 different positions. We will record the
experiment with the front monocular camera of the Pepper robot from Softbank
placed under the screen.
